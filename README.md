## FIFA World Cup Analysis

This repository contains the code, datasets, and visualizations for the project **"FIFA World Cup Analysis"**. The project explores historical FIFA World Cup data to uncover key patterns related to tournament success, continental performance, and top goal scorers.

##  Project Overview

The project focuses on three core research questions:

1. **Which countries have won the most FIFA World Cups, and how does their title count compare?**  
2. **How do representations among different football confederations (continent-wise) compare in the FIFA World Cup Knockouts?**  
3. **How has the number of goals scored by Golden Boot winners changed over time?**  

The analysis explores patterns of dominance by certain countries and confederations, as well as how the number of goals scored by the tournament’s top scorers has evolved over decades.
